                    To those enrolled in education of music, art, design or practice of almost any other area which we
                    do
                    not consider technical today:
                </div>

                <br>
                The interests of the general public in arts (broadly speaking) has seen a painful decline, and this
                isn’t any hidden truth. A decline in the enrolment of students in subjects that are art related for
                higher education on the entire planet, and more so, in developing nations is an expense being paid due
                to increased focus on vocational studies. I am in complete agreement of the fact that focusing on
                vocational subjects is a necessity. I however, am in complete disagreement with the attitude we have
                today towards arts.

                <br><br>
                The role of intellectuals, artists, designers, musicians, and any creative, unaffected of the countless
                times it is recited, will always remain understated. It is therefore important for the general public,
                by any means necessary, to know a lot more than they do about these people; about people like you. To
                criticise or to show disinterest after genuinely trying to learn is understandable. In fact, those who
                leave arts after trying to participate in the community leave with respect. However, I would like to
                emphasise that what is necessary, is to try and familiarise the general public with arts.

                <br><br>
                It is important for people like you to have a presence on the internet, where the general audience
                spends most of their time. Unlike almost every other thing on the internet, creatives like you do have
                a lot of content to share, content which when shared will be genuinely appreciated and respected. While
                I can speak a lot more on the matter, this isn’t what this page is about.

                <br><br>
                I understand that to get an internet presence, say through a creative website, is difficult and
                terrifyingly expensive - especially if you have no experience with programming or designing for the
                web. So you almost have to outsource it. This is what this project is about. This is in no way a full
                blown attempt to recover the lost respect for art, but a mere step towards it.

                <br><br>
                <div style="font-family: futura-bold">

                    If you do not know how to code and can not afford to have a presence on the internet through a
                    website,
                    if you are doing something in the areas related to arts or anything that I have mentioned
                    explicitly in
                    the beginning, you are doing the right thing being here, reading this. I’ll develop with you, a
                    creative and personal website such as this on which you’re reading (the complete website will be up
                    in
                    a couple of weeks), and you wouldn't be charged for it. You’ll see a ‘GET
                    IN
                    TOUCH’ button at the bottom of the screen. If you’re reading it through my share on any social
                    media
                    platform, feel free to message me there.

                As I said, this is only a mere step.
